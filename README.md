# Championship Database
Database for basketball championship that contains info about games, teams, players, coaches. You can find player statistics such as points per game and minutes on court.

This project was made in order for me to learn the basic capabilities of Microsoft SQL Server.

A database has been created. Then views, triggers have been created. I’ve made several selections, deletes, updates. Also I’ve worked with object permissions, metadata and isolation levels. In DB_scheme.jpg you can see a visual interpretation of my DB.

Furthermore my database can be used in real life.
