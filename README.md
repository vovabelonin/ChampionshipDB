# ChampionshipDB
 Database for basketball championship which contains info about games, teams, player, coaches. You can find player statistics like points per game, minutes on court.
 This project was made to learn the basic capabilities of Microsoft SQL Server.
 A database has been created. Then views, triggers were created. I made several selections, deletes, updates. And I worked with object permissions, metadata, isolation levels.
 In DB_scheme.jpg you can see a visual interpretation of my DB.
 Also my database can be used in real life.
